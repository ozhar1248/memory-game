# memory-game
When client connect to the server the sever waits for another client to connect in order to join them toghether into a single game.

The client is presented with a board of memory game
When its his turn the user choose two black cards. if they are the same color he gets 1 point and receives another turn.

The game ends when one of the users click "Quit" button or the game ends when all the cards have been exposed

The 2 clients connect to the server which manage the game

The project need refactoring and dealing with exceptions
